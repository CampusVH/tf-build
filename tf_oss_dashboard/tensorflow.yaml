title: TensorFlow GitHub CI Status
repo_owner: tensorflow
repo_name: tensorflow
repo_branch: master
help: >-
  This is TensorFlow's open-source build status dashboard. It tracks all GitHub
  statuses for the TensorFlow repository that are published to GitHub.

  Many of these jobs use Google's internal continuous integration systems, and
  may not report their results publicly. We're trying to make more of our
  important jobs visible to external developers, but security concerns make this
  a slow process.
